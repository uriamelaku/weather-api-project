# 🌤️ Weather API – Full-Stack Authentication & Data-Driven Application

A full-stack web application that allows users to register, authenticate, and retrieve real-time weather data for any city, while securely storing personal search history and favorite cities.

This project was built to demonstrate **end-to-end system design**, including backend architecture, authentication, database modeling, API integration, and frontend–backend interaction.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

The application enables:

- Secure user registration and login
- Token-based authentication using JWT
- Fetching live weather data from an external API
- Persisting user-specific data in MongoDB
- Managing personal search history and favorites

The focus of this project is **clean architecture, correctness, and real-world backend practices**, rather than UI complexity.

## 🧠 Key Technical Concepts Demonstrated

- Stateless authentication with JWT
- Middleware-based request authorization
- RESTful API design
- MongoDB schema modeling and relationships
- Separation of concerns (routes, middleware, models)
- Client–server communication using `fetch`
- Safe interaction with third-party APIs
- Git branching workflow and incremental development
